# Codecademy practice projects

For keeping and sharing code from the in-lesson projects.
Typically this will be where I think there is more that can be done with the code.
Often this will be where later lessons give scope for enhancing the program or where the program gives scope for practicing what comeslater.

Also for sharing for the purpose of evidence such as on the 100 Days of Code challenge.
